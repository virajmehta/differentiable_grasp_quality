# Differentiable Grasp Quality Tensorflow Op (dGQ)
### Viraj Mehta

This is a differentiable grasp quality operation based on an extension from the paper Synthesis of
force-closure grasps on 3-D objects based on the Q distance.

For a general summary of the mathematics behind this see the below paper.

Zhu, Xiangyang, and Jun Wang. "Synthesis of force-closure grasps on 3-D objects based on the Q distance." IEEE Transactions on robotics and Automation 19.4 (2003): 669-679.

The primary contribution of this piece of software is to extend the mathematics of the previous article to the general setting of a triangular mesh.

### Dependencies:
* [Tensorflow](tensorflow.org) (It's a tensorflow op so it needs the bones). You should be able to straigh

* [Clp](https://projects.coin-or.org/Clp) (for linear programming)
